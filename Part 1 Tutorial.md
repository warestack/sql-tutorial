### Part 1 Tutorial

#### What am I about to learn?

Today's lab session is essential for a solid start in this module. Make sure you complete all the tasks before the next class.

1. This lab part 1 focuses on how to use the basics of SQL.
2. List the databases that are already created.

```sql
mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| DBname             |
| information_schema |
| mydb               |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| sys                |
+--------------------+
6 rows in set (0.11 sec)
```

> This command shows the available databases; as you can see, a few were created already. In this tutorial, we will create a new database.

3. Create a new database called `film_db`.

```sql
mysql> CREATE DATABASE film_db;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.11 sec)
```

> The database is now ready so that we can `use` it.
>
> If you run the `SHOW DATABASES` command once more, the new database will appear on the list.

4. Select the `film_db` database as the current database to work on.

```sql
mysql> USE film_db;
Database changed
```

5. Create a new table called actors, following the following data and specification.

a. The table looks like this:

| actor_id | actor_first_name | actor_last_name | actor_city   |
| -------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| 1        | Tom              | Hanks           | Los  Angeles |
| 2        | Jude             | Law             | London       |
| 3        | Stephen          | Fry             | London       |

​	b. The table specification is as follows:

* `actor_id` is an integer so you will use an integer field `INT`. This field should accept unique values and cannot be empty.
* `actor_firstname` is based on characters, so that you will use the `VARCHAR`. This field will accept a maximum of 30 characters per input.
* `actor_last_name` is based on characters, so we will use the `VARCHAR`. This field will accept a maximum of 30 characters per input.
* `actor_city` is based on characters, so you will use the `VARCHAR`. This field will accept a maximum of 30 characters per input.

> Do not worry about the records for the moment; we only care about the creation of our table.

6. To create the table, run the following script.

```sql
CREATE TABLE actors (
actor_id INT(6),
actor_first_name VARCHAR(30),
actor_last_name VARCHAR(30),
actor_city VARCHAR(20),
PRIMARY KEY (actor_id)
);
```

> Note that when you type the command into the MySQL server, the terminal will look like this:
>
> ```shell
> mysql> CREATE TABLE actors (
>     -> actor_id INT(6),
>     -> actor_first_name VARCHAR(30),
>     -> actor_last_name VARCHAR(30),
>     -> actor_city VARCHAR(20),
>     -> PRIMARY KEY (actor_id)
>     -> );
> Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.14 sec)
> ```

> Each time you press and enter, you will see the `->` symbol.
>
> The `PRIMARY KEY`, ensures that the `actor_id` is always unique and cannot be empty. Do not worry about the `PRIMARY KEY` for the moment.

7. Now, run the `SHOW` command to see the available tables in the selected database.

```
mysql> SHOW TABLEs;
+-------------------+
| Tables_in_film_db |
+-------------------+
| actors            |
+-------------------+
1 row in set (0.11 sec)
```

8. Run the `DESCRIBE actors` command.

```shell
mysql> DESCRIBE actors;
+------------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field            | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+------------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| actor_id         | int         | NO   | PRI | NULL    |       |
| actor_first_name | varchar(30) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| actor_last_name  | varchar(30) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| actor_city       | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+------------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
4 rows in set (0.10 sec)
```

> The `DESCRIBE`command shows the structure of a table which including column names, data-types and the nullability which means, that column can contain null values or not.

9. Let us insert the data into the database using the following command.

```sql
mysql> INSERT INTO actors (actor_id, actor_first_name, actor_last_name, actor_city) 
VALUES 	(1, 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Los Angeles');
```

> Note that the command looks like this in SQL
>
> ```shell
> mysql> INSERT INTO actors (actor_id, actor_first_name, actor_last_name, actor_city)
>     -> VALUES (1, 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Los Angeles');
> Query OK, 1 row affected (0.11 sec)
> ```

10. It seems that our first record is now created! Now let's insert the other two records using a single script.

```mysql
mysql> INSERT INTO actors (actor_id, actor_first_name, actor_last_name, actor_city) 
VALUES 
(2, 'Jude', 'Law', 'London'),
(3, 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'London');
```

> The output shows `Query OK, 2 rows affected (0.01 sec)`, that means the records have been now created.

11. Let us run our first query to extract all the data from the `actors` table. For this query, you will use the `SELECT` command, so run the following script.

```mysql
mysql> SELECT * FROM actors;

+----------+------------------+-----------------+-------------+
| actor_id | actor_first_name | actor_last_name | actor_city  |
+----------+------------------+-----------------+-------------+
|        1 | Tom              | Hanks           | Los Angeles |
|        2 | Jude             | Law             | London      |
|        3 | Stephen          | Fry             | London      |
+----------+------------------+-----------------+-------------+
```

> The use of the `*` can help us to select all the available columns, so we can now extract and print all the columns and the data.
>
> :rotating_light: You can clear the terminal by pressing `ctl`+`L`. You can also bring up the previous commands by pressing the up button from the keyboard :arrow_up:. 
>
> * Press it, and you will see the last command.
> * Press up and down, and you will access all the previous commands.

12. Now, let us select only some of the columns, and run the next script.

```mysql
mysql> SELECT actor_first_name, actor_last_name, actor_city FROM actors;

+------------------+-----------------+-------------+
| actor_first_name | actor_last_name | actor_city  |
+------------------+-----------------+-------------+
| Tom              | Hanks           | Los Angeles |
| Jude             | Law             | London      |
| Stephen          | Fry             | London      |
+------------------+-----------------+-------------+
3 rows in set (0.11 sec)
```

13. Extract data for actors first and last names from the actors table, only for those living in London.

```mysql
mysql> SELECT actor_first_name, actor_last_name FROM actors WHERE actor_city='London';

+------------------+-----------------+
| actor_first_name | actor_last_name |
+------------------+-----------------+
| Jude             | Law             |
| Stephen          | Fry             |
+------------------+-----------------+
2 rows in set (0.11 sec)
```

14. We can change the `actor` table and include a new column called `salary`. The salary will store integer data of up to 10 digits. To add a new column, we will use the `ALTER TABLE` command.

```mysql
mysql> ALTER TABLE actors ADD salary INT(10);

Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.13 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 1
```

> Note that ideally, salary it should be named as `actor_salary` and it should be a float number.
>
> :rotating_light: Always be consistent when structuring your tables.

15. Let's drop the newly created column and then create it again using the appropriate naming and data type.

```mysql
mysql> ALTER TABLE actors DROP COLUMN salary;
```

16. Now let's create it again.

```mysql
mysql> ALTER TABLE actors ADD actor_salary FLOAT(10);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.12 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
```

17. Extract and print all the actors, now it should look better.

```mysql
mysql> SELECT * FROM actors;

+----------+------------------+-----------------+-------------+--------------+
| actor_id | actor_first_name | actor_last_name | actor_city  | actor_salary |
+----------+------------------+-----------------+-------------+--------------+
|        1 | Tom              | Hanks           | Los Angeles |         NULL |
|        2 | Jude             | Law             | London      |         NULL |
|        3 | Stephen          | Fry             | London      |         NULL |
+----------+------------------+-----------------+-------------+--------------+
3 rows in set (0.10 sec)
```

> As you can see, the `actor_salary` is initialised with a `NULL` for all the current records.

18. Let's update the actor salaries using the following scripts.

```mysql
mysql> UPDATE actors SET actor_salary = 1000 WHERE actor_id = 1;

Query OK, 1 row affected (0.11 sec)
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0
```

19. Let's confirm that the updated value is there.

```mysql
mysql> SELECT * FROM actors;

+----------+------------------+-----------------+-------------+--------------+
| actor_id | actor_first_name | actor_last_name | actor_city  | actor_salary |
+----------+------------------+-----------------+-------------+--------------+
|        1 | Tom              | Hanks           | Los Angeles |         1000 |
|        2 | Jude             | Law             | London      |         NULL |
|        3 | Stephen          | Fry             | London      |         NULL |
+----------+------------------+-----------------+-------------+--------------+
3 rows in set (0.10 sec)
```

20. Update the salaries of the next two records.

```mysql
mysql> UPDATE actors SET actor_salary = 2000 WHERE actor_id = 2;

Query OK, 1 row affected (0.11 sec)
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0
```

21. And, now the last record.

```mysql
mysql> UPDATE actors SET actor_salary = 3000 WHERE actor_id = 3;

Query OK, 1 row affected (0.11 sec)
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0
```

21. Use your up keyboard button :arrow_up_small: and bring up your `SELECT *` statement.

```mysql
mysql> SELECT * FROM actors;

+----------+------------------+-----------------+-------------+--------------+
| actor_id | actor_first_name | actor_last_name | actor_city  | actor_salary |
+----------+------------------+-----------------+-------------+--------------+
|        1 | Tom              | Hanks           | Los Angeles |         1000 |
|        2 | Jude             | Law             | London      |         2000 |
|        3 | Stephen          | Fry             | London      |         3000 |
+----------+------------------+-----------------+-------------+--------------+
3 rows in set (0.10 sec)
```

22. Let us select all the actors with a salary equal to or higher than 1500. Run the next command.

```
mysql> SELECT * FROM actors WHERE actors_salary>=1500;
ERROR 1054 (42S22): Unknown column 'actors_salary' in 'where clause'
```

> It seems that I have an error, the correct column name is `actor_salary`!
>
> Always read the `ERROR` statement. Now, let's fix it.

```mysql
mysql> SELECT * FROM actors WHERE actor_salary>=1500;

+----------+------------------+-----------------+------------+--------------+
| actor_id | actor_first_name | actor_last_name | actor_city | actor_salary |
+----------+------------------+-----------------+------------+--------------+
|        2 | Jude             | Law             | London     |         2000 |
|        3 | Stephen          | Fry             | London     |         3000 |
+----------+------------------+-----------------+------------+--------------+
2 rows in set (0.10 sec)
```

23. Let's insert more data in the database.

```mysql
mysql> INSERT INTO actors
    -> VALUES
    -> (4, 'Will', 'Smith', 'Los Angeles', 4000),
    -> (5, 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Los Angeles', 5000);
    
Query OK, 2 rows affected (0.11 sec)
Records: 2  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
```

> You might notice that we did not define the column names in the `INSERT INTO actors` statement. Each time you insert data into all the records, you skip typing the column names. 
>
> To summarise, you can either type:
>
> ```mysql
>INSERT INTO actors 
> 	(actor_id, actor_first_name, actor_last_name, actor_city, actor_salary)
> VALUES 
> 	...
> ```
> 
> Or use the following:
>
> ```mysql
>INSERT INTO actors 
> VALUES 
> 	...
> ```

24. Extract all the actors once more.

```mysql
mysql> SELECT * FROM actors;

+----------+------------------+-----------------+-------------+--------------+
| actor_id | actor_first_name | actor_last_name | actor_city  | actor_salary |
+----------+------------------+-----------------+-------------+--------------+
|        1 | Tom              | Hanks           | Los Angeles |         1000 |
|        2 | Jude             | Law             | London      |         2000 |
|        3 | Stephen          | Fry             | London      |         3000 |
|        4 | Will             | Smith           | Los Angeles |         4000 |
|        5 | Angelina         | Jolie           | Los Angeles |         5000 |
+----------+------------------+-----------------+-------------+--------------+
5 rows in set (0.10 sec)
```

25. Let us select all the actors with a salary between 1500 and 4000. Note that between means including 1500 and 4000.

```mysql
mysql> SELECT * FROM actors WHERE actor_salary BETWEEN 1500 AND 4000;

+----------+------------------+-----------------+-------------+--------------+
| actor_id | actor_first_name | actor_last_name | actor_city  | actor_salary |
+----------+------------------+-----------------+-------------+--------------+
|        2 | Jude             | Law             | London      |         2000 |
|        3 | Stephen          | Fry             | London      |         3000 |
|        4 | Will             | Smith           | Los Angeles |         4000 |
+----------+------------------+-----------------+-------------+--------------+
3 rows in set (0.10 sec)
```

26. There is an alternative way to run this command, which is as follows.

```mysql
mysql> SELECT * FROM actors WHERE actor_salary>=1500 AND actor_salary<=4000;

+----------+------------------+-----------------+-------------+--------------+
| actor_id | actor_first_name | actor_last_name | actor_city  | actor_salary |
+----------+------------------+-----------------+-------------+--------------+
|        2 | Jude             | Law             | London      |         2000 |
|        3 | Stephen          | Fry             | London      |         3000 |
|        4 | Will             | Smith           | Los Angeles |         4000 |
+----------+------------------+-----------------+-------------+--------------+
3 rows in set (0.11 sec)
```

> I can define the selection boundaries using the appropriate conditions:
>
> * `>`: greater
>
> *  `<`: less
> * `<=`: less or equal
> * `>=`: greater or equal
> * `=`: equal
> * `<>`: not equal (or `!=` can be used)

27. Extract all the data except the data for the actor with id `2`.

```mysql
mysql> SELECT * FROM actors WHERE actor_id<>2;

+----------+------------------+-----------------+-------------+--------------+
| actor_id | actor_first_name | actor_last_name | actor_city  | actor_salary |
+----------+------------------+-----------------+-------------+--------------+
|        1 | Tom              | Hanks           | Los Angeles |         1000 |
|        3 | Stephen          | Fry             | London      |         3000 |
|        4 | Will             | Smith           | Los Angeles |         4000 |
|        5 | Angelina         | Jolie           | Los Angeles |         5000 |
+----------+------------------+-----------------+-------------+--------------+
4 rows in set (0.10 sec)
```

28. Now, let us delete the actor with id 5 from our table using the following command.

```mysql
mysql> DELETE FROM actors WHERE actor_id = 5;

Query OK, 1 row affected (0.11 sec)
```

> :rotating_light: Use the `DELETE` command with care, a wrong `DELETE` statement might delete a lot of data!

29. Extract all the data once more.

```mysql
mysql> SELECT * FROM actors;

+----------+------------------+-----------------+-------------+--------------+
| actor_id | actor_first_name | actor_last_name | actor_city  | actor_salary |
+----------+------------------+-----------------+-------------+--------------+
|        1 | Tom              | Hanks           | Los Angeles |         1000 |
|        2 | Jude             | Law             | London      |         2000 |
|        3 | Stephen          | Fry             | London      |         3000 |
|        4 | Will             | Smith           | Los Angeles |         4000 |
+----------+------------------+-----------------+-------------+--------------+
4 rows in set (0.10 sec)
```

30. Well done :clap: , you completed the first MySQL tutorial.

:checkered_flag: Well done!
